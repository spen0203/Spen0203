      <h2>About Me! </h2>

        <p>I grew up in a tiny community in central ontario,
           with little interest in livestock I found myself online researching technology
           starting from a young age. By the time I was in highschool I had studied computer repair
           and built my own computer. It was clear to me by this point I wanted to work with technology,
          Lucky for me my high school offered Co-op and intruduction to programming. 
          During theese years I learnt to create basic java applications and to diagnose and repair various software 
          and hardware problems. When I graduated I had one goal, to find a Software Enginering program that offered Co-op.
          This lead me to a Three year program at Algonquin College.
           Here I began my indepth programming journey learning several languages and concepts.
           I did one of my two available four month coops to gain an understanding of the corporate enviroment,
           but opted out of my second to allow me to pursue a more flexible web development job
            that would work with my school schedule. 
        </p>

        <p>
          Now that i'm set to graduate I hope to find a steady career preferably in downtown Ottawa or surronding area, 
          I hope to find a workplace that will promote learning and push me to excel in everything I do not just programming.
          I want a career that may feel intimidating at times but will allow me to learn the most, one growth is promoted.
        </p>
